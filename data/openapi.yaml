  title: Match Project dataset API
  description: >
    This API exposes the Match Project dataset. It is a mix of four data sources:
    * The infogreffe opendata ; https://opendata.datainfogreffe.fr/explore/dataset/chiffres-cles-2022/.
    * Smaller tables summarizing the Codes APE that classifies the companies depending on their activity. from https://www.insee.fr/fr/information/2028155. There are 21 sections, 88 divisions, 272 groups, 615 classes, and 732 sub-classes. We use principally the divisions and sub-classes.
    * Flat data summarizing some general information and key economical indicators for companies in the Ile de France Region. It gathers the information of about 17,000 companies. These key indicators would be used for machine learning.
    * A list of websites from the BnF ( https://bnf.libguides.com/signets_prisme/sectoriels ) where there is an inventory of corporation or associations corresponding to the BnF classification. In the project a first junction table with the Divisions mentioned above has been made, however improvements are  underworks.
    
    The API only enables to get some basic information about the companies (general and declared revenues/incomes. For more access let me know.
