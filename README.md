Final Project IronHack Bootcamp

Thanks a lot to visit this repository.
You will find in it the results of my 10 days first sizeable project on my own.
Enjoy the visit.

1# Project Title: match_project

2# Description, overview of the project: 
It is still in development phase!
When you are planning to open a business, when you are already running a business and growing (or not) it is never straightforward and easy to gather information about:
-	Your market, who are the players?
-	Your competition, who is already there running the show?
-	Your potential partners, would it be possible to join forces?
-	How good the others are doing
-	If you need to expand, with whom to talk to?
-	
In particular for entrepreneurs and SMEs. You always need to rely on experts and go through consultancy. Similarly, for bigger actors, companies that need to expand externally, it is always a challenge to identify a suitable possible target. In this case also we rely on experts and professionals to do the work for us.
The idea of the project is to make a tool to help, for possible market analysis, to get first answers and directions in identifying companies depending on the activities and size. Identifying key companies so you get a better grasp of the market you want to work in , or for possible partnerships. 
From multisource data (Infogreffe, Cap-Fi, pappers, BnF, Insee…) and combining them, the idea is to be able to narrow down a starting point for more investigation and… more data gathering.
We are at the beginning of defining a tool, and many things can be done from the data gathered. For the sake of the exercise, we will look more in detail the codes APE 62.02A (Conseil en systèmes et logiciels informatiques) and APE 70.22Z (Conseil pour les affaires et autres conseils de gestion) in Paris.  Can we understand a bit better the market from the data gathered? Could we infer some suggestions?

The exercise is to apply our learnings in EDA and Data Cleaning Performance Metrics Hypothesis testing Experiment Evaluation Tableau Setup
The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

3# Installation: Instructions on how to install and set up the project locally. This may include dependencies that need to be installed.
Have a look at the ERD schematic to understand how the match_project database is set up.
Regarding the data, there is one file missing, the management table, as it contains names of managers and owners of companies. Contact me in need.
Otherwise, you will find the link the the infogreffe data (too big to be on this repository), and the other tables are present in csv format.

4# Usage: Guidelines on how to use the project. 
Configuration or setup required: make sure you have imported the latest versions of the python librairies used in the notebook: Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, pickle, 
No specific guideline. The main points of the project are summarized in the presentation (to come). 
To get more in the details you can go through the Jupiter Notebook in order to see the preparation of the data and first analysis, to have an idea of how the work was done.
There are 4 notebooks and a .py file:
First_looks is about the work on the Infogreffe data.
Second_look is about the work on the Ile de France specific data, as well as the machine learning exercise
Third_look is about how I got the data via an API
Fourth_look is about the web scrapping of a BnF page

5# Contributing:
