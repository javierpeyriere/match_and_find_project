1# Project Title: match_and_find_project

TO UPDATE

EDA and Data Cleaning Performance Metrics Hypothesis testing Experiment Evaluation Tableau Setup
The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

2# Description, overview of the project
The digital world is evolving, and so are Vanguard’s clients. Vanguard believed that a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could make the online process smoother for clients. The critical question was: Would these changes encourage more clients to complete the process?

An A/B test was set into motion from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017 by the team.

Control Group: Clients interacted with Vanguard’s traditional online process.
Test Group: Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.
Both groups navigated through an identical process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and finally, a confirmation page signaling process completion.

The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

3# Installation: Instructions on how to install and set up the project locally. This may include dependencies that need to be installed.
We have attached a function_file.py to simplify the code. Note that on deepnote it was requiring extra import. As a secondary option the functions are within the code and can be run in the notebook appendices.

4# Usage: Guidelines on how to use the project. 
Configuration or setup required: make sure you have imported the latest versions of the python librairies used in the notebook and function_file: Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, 
Not specific guideline. The main points of the project are summarized in the presentation. 
To get more in the details you can go through the Jupiter Notebook in order to see the preparation of the data and first analysis, to have an idea of how the work was done, in particular regarding the hypothesis testing.
There are additional Tableau files to be used for further or more in detail analysis of the data.

5# Examples:
